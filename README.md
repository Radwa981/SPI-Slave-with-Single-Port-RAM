# SPI-Slave-with-Single-Port-RAM
This project implements a Verilog-based SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) Slave module designed to interface with a single-port RAM using a finite state machine (FSM) to decode and execute basic read and write commands. The module receives serial data from an SPI Master via the MOSI line, decodes the operation type (read/write) based on the first bit received, and then either stores incoming data into RAM or retrieves stored data for transmission on the MISO line. The FSM is composed of well-defined states including IDLE, CHK_CMD, WRITE, READ_ADD, and READ_DATA, each responsible for a specific stage in the communication and memory operation flow. The design handles serial-to-parallel conversion, memory addressing, and register updates, while ensuring proper synchronization with the SPI clock and chip-select signals. It features dedicated registers for received and transmitted data (rx_data, tx_data), along with control signals (rx_valid, tx_valid) to mark data readiness. This module can be integrated into larger FPGA systems that require communication with microcontrollers or SPI-enabled processors, and serves as a practical example of combining communication protocols with memory-mapped operations in a hardware design. The project is cleanly structured and parameterizable, making it suitable for learning, testing, or real-world use in embedded and digital systems.
