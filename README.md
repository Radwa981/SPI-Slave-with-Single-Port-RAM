# SPI-Slave-with-Single-Port-RAM
This project implements a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) Slave module in Verilog, designed to communicate with an SPI Master and interface with internal memory (single-port RAM). The design is structured around a finite state machine (FSM) that ensures reliable reception, decoding, and memory operations based on SPI commands.
